If you would let me know what exceptions you need to add I will start a list in this document.
	
11) Start your server and join. By default missions will start spawning in around 5-10 min. 

//////////////////////////
// Adjusting configurations settings
a) Unpack custom_server.pbo
b) Make a backup of the relevant configuration file (custom_server\Configs\epoch_configs.sqf)
c) open the mod-specific configuration file custom_server\Configs\epoch_configs.sqf) in Notepad++ or another text editor
d) Modify settings as desired.
e) Repack custom_server.pbo


///////////////////////
//  Can I add map, mod or server-specific overrides for certain settings?

Yes !
You can use blck_custom_config.sqf to code any overrides you like. An example for changing some settings for Namalsk is provided.

////////////////////////
// What is this blck_debugON variable about?
It turns on accelerated mission spawning by default and activates additional logging.
You can turn it on or of in custom_server\Compiles\blck_variables.sqf.
Be careful about what you change in this file. 

///////////////////////////////////////////
// Further customization

Just about anything about the missions can be modified. The mission template (see Missions\Orange\supply_camp.sqf and Missions\Blue\default.sqf for examples) allows you to define mission specific parameters.
To create a new mission, make a copy of a mission template (e.g., custom_server\Blue\default.sqf). Edit the parameters to your liking and rename to file appropriately.
To add a new mission, create a new mission template, then add the file name (e.g., "newmissions.sqf") to the mission list found in custom_server\Missions. 
That mission will now be spawned whenever it is selected from teh list.
