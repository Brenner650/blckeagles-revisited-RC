Tools for blckeagls

These tools should facilitate exporting information from the editor when creating new static or dynamic missions.

I will cover configuration of Static Missions first.

Because the tools are not yet available as a plug in for the editor, you need to do a bit of preparation to use them but its nothing too difficult.

/////////////////////
The basic steps are:
/////////////////////
Lay out your mission in the editor. 
Note that the first thing you do should be to place a unit who will be your player character while you use the tools.
Then, place the units, vehicles, structures, loot crates, and any other elements. 
Ror static missions be sure to also place a marker.

Now, copy the sqf files from the tool folders into your mission folder.
'Play' the mission. 
Tools will be available through the action menu.

For static missions, just scrolll through the options with your mouse wheel and select the option to "Add Static Mission Configuration to Clipboard".
The mission configurations will be copied to the clipboard.
Alt-Tab out and open your favorite text editor, then paste the output into a new file.
You are now ready to modify the static mission template by pasting in the information about markers and various units.
Note that you will have to define a few variables like _crateLoot and_lootCounts.

Any other variables you wish to adjust in the template can be modified at this time.

//////////////////
Dynamic Missions
/////////////////

For dynamic missions, the steps are similar but a bit more is involved.

First, configure yoru mission as above.

Hit Play.
Set a mission center which is used to calculate the relative position of objects. 
You can define it by placing a traffic cone with a light on it at the center point of your mission then selecting the action menu choice to use it a the center 
OR
by moving to the spot you want to be the center and selecting the appropriate option with your mouse wheel.
Next just select the menu option you want for the mode in which configs are exported. 
There are two possible methods to export configurations.
The first dumps everything into a single list of objects.
The second pre-configures the definitions used in the mission file.
The output is copied to the clipboard as above.
Once the script is done just paste ito you script editor and merge that content with a mission template.
